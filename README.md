# uix draft

uix is my attempt to build a modern UI framework (well, yet another one).

# Why uix?

1. Using RequireJS for modules loading and building allows uix to be integrated in project easily with typing `volo add uix`
2. Using Twitter Bootstrap as base CSS framework allows to write beautifull interfaces.
3. Declarative widgets description. uix widgets may be declared in JSON, XML, HTML or Jade file.
4. Dependency auto-loading and auto-building.
When UI is defined in separate file, uix dependencies are loaded (and built for production) automatically.

# What is this repo about?

This repo is not a uix library. It is a playground where uix is developed.
When it reaches alpha-status, it will be moved in anothe repo from where it may be installed properly.

I encourage open-source JS developers (English or Russian speakers) to join
the project and to make contributions in specification draft and of course code.
